## Version 2.x ðŸŽ‰ - 2024-02-08

### Big update with breaking changes

- I've added tests. It was a challenge as there is very little resources on how to test FilamentPHP packages ðŸ˜Ž
- We now pass the whole `Model` to the views. So, you don't need to define the data you need to use. Just use them.
- You now tell us which `Model` you're managing on this Kanban board, and we do most things for you. You don't have to override any methods. This includes loading records, updating them, sorting them, editing them, etc.
- We now include a text input for editing the title in the edit form by default.

Imagine if you had this:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Pages;

use App\Enums\UserStatus;
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Rafazingano\FilamentKanban\Pages\KanbanBoard;

class UserDashboard extends KanbanBoard
{
    protected function statuses(): Collection
    {
        return UserStatus::statuses();
    }

    protected function records(): Collection
    {
        return User::ordered()->get();
    }

    public function onStatusChanged(int $recordId, string $status, array $fromOrderedIds, array $toOrderedIds): void
    {
        User::find($recordId)->update(['status' => $status]);

        User::setNewOrder($toOrderedIds);
    }

    public function onSortChanged(int $recordId, string $status, array $orderedIds): void
    {
        User::find($recordId)->touch('updated_at');
        
        User::setNewOrder($orderedIds);
    }

    protected function getEditModalFormSchema(null|int $recordId): array
    {
        return [
            TextInput::make('title'),
        ];
    }

    protected function getEditModalRecordData($recordId, $data): array
    {
        return User::find($recordId)->toArray();
    }

    protected function editRecord($recordId, array $data, array $state): void
    {
        User::find($recordId)->update([
            'title' => $data['title']
        ]);
    }

    protected function additionalRecordData(Model $record): Collection
    {
        return collect([
            'deficiencies' => $record->deficiencies,
        ]);
    }
}










```
Now you can have just this:

```php
use App\Enums\UserStatus;
use App\Models\User;
use Rafazingano\FilamentKanban\Pages\KanbanBoard;

class UserDashboard extends KanbanBoard
{
    protected static ?string $model = User::class;
    protected static ?string $statusEnum = UserStatus::class;
}










```

## v1.11.0 - 2024-01-30

- add visual feedback to records that "just updated"

## hacky fix to the actual issue - 2024-01-19

the previous attempt at fixing the issue with form that have a rich editor in them wasn't addressing the actual issue.

the issue is that when you have a working rich editor in the form, sometimes the form schema is created before the click record action is handled, which makes the form use the obsolete `$editModalRecordId`.

the form didn't have an issue before adding `mount` with `$form->fill()` only because the rich editor was broken.
and when you fix it by adding the `mount` method, it starts messing up the flow. if you don't set the `$editModalRecordId` to null you might feel like you're avoiding some issues, but the form is using old `$editModalRecordId` for building schema.

here I've manually triggered a schema creation inside the click handler to fix the issue, but i don't like it.

would appreciate if you have better solutions.

## fix edit modal not receving record id after updating another model if a richtext is present - 2024-01-19

this was a weird one.

if you have a `RichText` in your form schema, and you update one of the records, the next time you click on a card the form won't receive the `recordId` in `getEditModalFormSchema`.

this fixes it.

hopefully not introducing any regression. i set the record id to `null` as a safety measure anyway.
